Work List:

* Create a parent class for ships.  Among other things make it compute and store
  the "center of mass" (prolly geometric centriod or an approx. thereof).
   
*  About the keyboard control issue (one ships controls hogging the response):  
...seems to be ameliorated now I've eliminated statistics gathering and the
...render versus just update the game state stuff (which leads to a task:...

*  Put update and render if time to render has passed code in (don't worry if 
   the chance to render comes late as the above works for that too).
   
   ?? Am I properly managing the time interval for the game state update
      (i.e. not letting accelerations be affected by the processing speed,
            but instead be keyed off ration of elapsed/unit time).
