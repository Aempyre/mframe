Two basic game loops:


Simulation.
* Time based physical simulation loop that interacts with the client games
  object, logic, input, and data models.



Interactive.
* Turn based loop that plugs into the client games logic, input & output
  facilities, and data model.



note:  in future could combine in a way by embedding little simulation games
       in stages / pages of interactive adventures / novels where the starting
       configuration of the embedded simulation is based on the state of the
       interactive game at that time, and the result of the simulation is fed
       back into the interactive game.
